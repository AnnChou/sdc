    FHIR provides numerous extensions for Questionnaire, many of them related to how the questionnaire should be rendered.  SDC includes the
    <a href="sdc-questionnaire-render.html">sdc-questionnaire-render</a> profile which highlights what extensions are available and where they are intended 
    to be used.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="questionnaire-sdc-profile-example-render.html">This example</a> highlights most of these extensions and shows how they should be used. This 
    <a href="questionnaire-sdc-profile-example-render.pdf">companion PDF</a> shows what a system rendering the Questionnaire according to the extensions included
    might look like.

  <h3>Rendering Extensions</h3>

  <h3>Additional rendering considerations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Questionnaires will be rendered by a variety of tools on a variety of devices.  Not all tools will necessarily support all extensions - or even
      all core elements.  Authors should recognize this and only depend on extensions if they're confident that all systems using the Questionnaire will
      support the needed extensions.  Note that this doesn't mean that extensions can't be used, only that the Questionnaire should be safe to use if
      extensions that the author isn't certain will be supported are not supported.</li>
    <li>Tools that use HTML to render forms should consider disabling browser-based auto-completion unless such behavior is is desired</li>
  </ul>
