    FHIR provides numerous extensions for Questionnaire, many of them related to how the data should be populated and how the user should navigate the form - e.g. what elements questions should be displayed,
    what data should be calculated, etc.  SDC defines the
    <a href="sdc-questionnaire-behave.html">sdc-questionnaire-behave</a> profile to highlight what extensions are available and where they are intended to be used.
